# My Portfolio PHP/Laravel backend

This is an incomplete build of my new portfolio project.  In this iteration, I was having issue with sanctum.  I discovered that in order for sanctum to work, vue and laravel have to be in the same directory.  This one was not so, I decided to rebuild it and copy all the components into a new portfolio project called TBportfolio
