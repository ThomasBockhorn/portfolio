                    Hi, my name is Thomas Bockhorn. I'm a full stack web
                    developer. Hi Building websites are fun and challanging.
                    Websites can also be creative endevors that inspire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first got into web development with an invitation by
                    Udacity including a nice Google scholarship for their
                    front-end web development program. After taking a few
                    lessions, I became hooked on all things web development. To
                    further my education, I took and continue to take Udemy
                    courses for both front-end and back-end development. The
                    beauty of both technical and asthetic spheres and how they
                    interacted together fascinated me. Just like architecture,
                    good websites need to consider both form and function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other source of inspiration is history and the art of
                    telling stories. I received a Master degree in history. Good
                    historical narratives and websites share how important the
                    central theme is and how essential the human connection is.
                    History and websites can be dry and boring, or can be
                    interesting and compelling. It all depends on the content. I
                    try to make compelling websites that garner viewer's
                    attention.
                </p>
                <p>I work with Java, PHP, Laravel, CSS, HTML, Vue, MySql.</p>
