                    Hi, my name is Thomas Bockhorn. I'm a full stack web
                    developer. Building websites and web applications is fun and
                    challenging. Websites can also be creative endevors that
                    inspire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first got into web development with an invitation by
                    Udacity including a Google scholarship for their front-end
                    web development program. After taking a few lessions, I
                    became hooked on all things web development. To further my
                    education, I took and continue to take Udemy courses for
                    both front-end and back-end development. The beauty of both
                    technical and asthetic spheres and how they interacted
                    together fascinated me. Just like architecture, good
                    websites need to consider both form and function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My other source of inspiration is history and the art of
                    telling stories. I received a Master's degree in history.
                    Good historical narratives and websites share how important
                    the central theme is and how essential the human connection
                    is. History and websites can be dry and boring, or can be
                    interesting and compelling. It all depends on the content. I
                    make compelling websites that garner viewer's attention.
                </p>
                <p>I work with Java, Spring, PHP, Laravel, CSS, HTML, Vue, MySql.</p>
